# Project Overview: Animated Monkey Login Page
This project aims to create a playful and engaging login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core of this project is a monkey character animation, which is incorporated into the page to make it interactive and fun for the users. The animation will be coupled with a functional login form to ensure that the page can also be used for real-world authentication scenarios.

Project Structure
HTML (Structure): The HTML part is responsible for setting up the skeleton of the login page. This includes the layout of the login form, buttons, and other HTML elements such as headings, input fields, and containers for the animated monkey.

CSS (Styling): The CSS will be used to style the page and create the animation effects for the monkey character. This includes:

Styling the background, buttons, and text inputs.
Positioning the monkey character and applying animations like jumps, swinging, or simple movements to make the page more lively and entertaining.
JavaScript (Functionality & Interactivity): JavaScript will be used to handle user input, validation of the login credentials, and interaction with the monkey animation. For example:

A simple login form validation to check for empty fields or invalid inputs.
Animating the monkey when the user clicks the login button or after a failed login attempt to add a bit of fun to the process.
Features of the Animated Monkey Login Page
Interactive Monkey Animation:

The monkey could be animated using CSS keyframes or JavaScript. For example, the monkey might wave, jump, or swing on a vine when the user interacts with the login form (such as when they focus on the input fields or click the login button).
You could add a small, funny animation that triggers when an invalid login attempt is made (such as the monkey shaking its head in disappointment).
Responsive Design:

The layout and animations will be responsive, meaning they will adjust to different screen sizes, including mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
The login form will be centered and easily accessible across all screen resolutions.
Login Form Elements:

Username and Password Fields: The main fields for user input.
Login Button: The button that submits the login information.
Error Messages: If the user inputs incorrect credentials, animated error messages will appear near the monkey (for example, the monkey could point at the error message).
Form Validation:

Simple JavaScript validation will check whether the username and password fields are filled out before submission.
If validation fails, the page will show error messages and display a brief animation of the monkey indicating something went wrong (e.g., the monkey facepalming).
Cute Monkey Graphics:

You can either design your own monkey graphics using CSS (using shapes, borders, and colors) or use an external image/animation (like an SVG or GIF) for the monkey.
